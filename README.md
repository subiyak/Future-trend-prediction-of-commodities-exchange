This project seeks to utilize Deep Learning models, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network algorithm, to predict stock prices

We will use Keras to build a LSTM to predict stock prices using closing price of a particular firm and visualize  the predicted price values over time .

For data with time frames recurrent neural networks (RNNs) come in handy but recent researches have shown that LSTM, networks are the most popular and useful variants of RNNs.
